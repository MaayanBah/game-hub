### Built With ðŸ›

### To set up the GameHub website, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MaayanBah/game-hub
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Obtain a RAWG API key from the [RAWG API documentation](https://rawg.io/apidocs). Note that you'll need to create an account.
4. Add your API key to `src/services/api-client.ts`
5. Create a `.env` file in the project's directory, with `VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` configured (See [Spotify's official guide](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/getting-started#request-an-access-token)). Your `.env` file should look something like this:

   ```bash
   VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR-SPOTIFY-CLIENT-ID>
   VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR-SPOTIFY-CLIENT-SECRET>
   ```

6. Start the web server
